## A course design for the mcu(stc89c52) 

It means that it will just be a demo.

## This project mainly solved the UART communacation from 89c52 to ESP8266 which could connect the internet

## To demonstrate its ability to communicate in both directions thanks to a custom communication protocolï¼ŒI also hava done an Android app to demonstrate.


Here I will list some of helpful webpages which have supported this small project.(To avoid page invalid, a backup is made here)
